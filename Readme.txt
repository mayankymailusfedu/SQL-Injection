"home.html" is the default page.

This webpage is the home page of the website that is created for practicing SQL Injection.

There is a navigation bar which has following main option: SQL, Search, Sign In

If you click on Search, the page will be directed to a page where you can search the products that the website sells.

If you click on Sign In, the page will be directed to a Login page.
 
If you click on SQL, the page will be directed to the tutorial site for learning SQL Injection.

I have provided all commands for creating the whole database (with tables and values) in "MySQL Commands.txt" file.

I have used MySQL as Database Management System and xampp as server.

For making my hardware website as default website for localhost, I made some changes in "index.php" file in xampp folder. I made some changes in the header. The changes are as follows:  "header('Location: '.$uri.'/hardware/');"

SQL Ninja can be only applied if the host is using Microsoft SQL Server, but I am using MySQL. Therefore SQL Ninja cannot be performed on this website. I talked to Dr. Ventura regarding this and he said its fine and submit what I have done and specify the fact in the Readme text file.

I am still providing a link for SQL Ninja website home page and they have very nice documentation plus demo video for working with SQL Ninja. – “http://sqlninja.sourceforge.net/sqlninjademo.html”
